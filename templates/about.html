            <h5>What We Found</h5>
            <p>A recent study analyzed mortgage performance and found that homebuyers who purchased in 2022 
            experienced significantly higher rates of payment problems compared to other years.</p>
            
            <h6>Key Findings:</h6>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rising Interest Rates:</strong> 2022 was a transition year from low to high rates, 
                    leaving borrowers with higher payments and fewer refinancing options.</li>
                <li><strong>Peak Inflation:</strong> High inflation reduced purchasing power and increased 
                    living costs for borrowers.</li>
                <li><strong>Declining Savings:</strong> Personal savings rates dropped dramatically in 2022 
                    after pandemic highs, reducing financial cushions.</li>
                <li><strong>Increasing Debt:</strong> Household debt levels surged, particularly credit card 
                    and student loan debt.</li>
            </ul>
